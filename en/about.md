      <h2>About This Blog</h2>
      <p>This is a personal travel blog introducing small cities in the Gyeongnam region of Korea. Written from the perspective of an office worker in his 30s, it shares everyday places and small stories centered around Jinju and the broader Gyeongnam area.</p>
      
      <p>Rather than famous tourist attractions, I aim to introduce precious places that can be discovered in daily lifeâ€”restaurants frequented by locals, quiet walking paths, small museums, and the like.</p>
