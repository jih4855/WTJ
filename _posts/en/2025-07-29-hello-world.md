Hello.

With this blog, I plan to introduce the Gyeongnam region, starting with the neighborhood I live in. To be honest, I'm not sure how much people will connect with posts written from the perspective of a guy in his 30s.

Frankly, I'm not even sure how long this will last. I might post a few articles, or perhaps this first one will be my last.

Nevertheless, there are a few reasons why I decided to start this blog.

## First Reason: Korean Culture Goes Mainstream

First, I wanted to ride the wave of Korean culture, which has now become mainstream. If I had tried this 10 years ago, would it have received any attention? I doubt it. Back then, Korean culture was strictly niche, and we were the kind of people who would get all excited over a single, minor Korean element in an American movie or drama.

Recently, a work called 'K-Pop Demon Hunters' received a lot of love. It's set in Korea and masterfully incorporated subtle Korean details, like the habit of placing a napkin under a spoon or using the sofa as a backrest while sitting on the floor. Nevertheless, upon its initial release, the reaction in Korea was lukewarm. A meme even went viral saying, "The title is the biggest barrier to entry." (Stop the cringey nationalism!)

I find myself thinking, "Could there be a better time to introduce Korea than now?" It seems the time has come when even introducing a small, provincial city—not a major hub like Seoul or Busan—might receive a little bit of attention.

## Second Reason: I Don't Know My Own Town

Another reason is that I, myself, don't know this town very well. I came to Jinju for work about five years ago, but looking back, besides the roads I always travel, I don't know any of the famous restaurants or the best paths for a walk. I've never been much of an outdoors person, and I tend to hesitate before trying new things.

Lately, I feel like time is passing too quickly. They say that because our brains don't specifically store repetitive daily routines, time seems to fly by like an arrow when there's no new stimulation. I suddenly felt a sense of regret for the time that has passed without any special memories.

## Third Reason: The Help of LLMs

Finally, this blog will primarily be run in English and Japanese. The help of LLMs was crucial for this. Last October, I started looking into AI, thinking it might help with my job search, and I was astounded by its potential. Thanks to this dazzling technological advancement, I found the courage to try something I wouldn't have even dared to attempt before. 

As the posts will be translated using an LLM, I ask for your understanding if there are any shortcomings. Please feel free to let me know if you find any awkward or problematic expressions.

## Future Plans

I plan to start with the small things—visiting a local eatery, or even going to a museum, as cliché as that might sound.

I look forward to sharing this journey with you.
