Hello. This is Geumsan.

I've only seen 'K-Pop Demon Hunters' (hereafter KPDH or 'Kedaeheon') once, but my YouTube algorithm is still full of it. Various singers are creating a buzz by covering 'Golden,' and cosplay videos keep popping up in my recommendations. I've also seen a fair number of Shorts explaining the details, so I thought I'd share some thoughts that came to mind while watching 'Kedaeheon'.

## 1. Saja (Lion), Saja (Messenger), and Dokkaebi

The 'Saja Boyz' light stick logo is in the shape of a lion (사자, Saja). I didn't realize it at first, but 'Saja Boyz' signifies the 저승사자 (Jeoseung-saja, the Korean Grim Reaper or messenger from the afterlife). It seems that using the Grim Reaper image directly for a boy band would be too burdensome, so they likely used a homonym—'saja' for lion—as a clever substitute.

As I see it, the demons in 'KPDH' come in two main forms. One is the Jeoseung-saja type, like the 'Saja Boyz', and the rest have the appearance of 도깨비 (Dokkaebi, Korean goblins or mythical creatures). The Dokkaebi are known to enjoy pranks and wrestling; I remember hearing stories as a kid about a drunk person who wrestled a Dokkaebi all night, only to find it was a broom or a telephone pole the next morning.

In 'KPDH,' there doesn't seem to be a special distinction made between them. A Jeoseung-saja's original role is to guide human souls to the afterlife, but here, all the demons offer souls to Guima. So, in a broader sense, you could say they are all doing the work of a Jeoseung-saja.

The image of the Jeoseung-saja in 'KPDH' is a relatively modern creation (from about 40 years ago?). It began with the classic Korean ghost drama 'Hometown of Legends.' Before this show, there was no specific visual representation of the Jeoseung-saja. The story goes that the show's PD created the image to maximize the feeling of horror. (<a href="https://youtu.be/Gb5UMVNEXfs?si=FDxhn5RAmA36m1Bd" target="_blank">Reference: 'You Quiz on the Block' interview</a>)

In modern times, they often appear in dramas and films wearing a black suit and a fedora. The 2016 tvN drama 'Goblin' and the movie 'Along with the Gods' are prime examples. (※'Hometown of Legends' is a show I remember watching in elementary school, so it's at least 25 years old and might be hard to find.)

## 2. The Palja of Entertainers and Mudang

Early in the show, there's a brief scene showing the lineage from a shaman to the Hunttrix. At first, I had a fleeting thought: "Why the random jump from a shaman to an idol?"

However, in Korea, there's a saying that is often mentioned: "The 팔자 (Palja, one's given fate or destiny) of an entertainer and a 무당 (Mudang, a Korean shaman) are similar." The exact origin is unknown, but it seems to have gained enough popular consensus to be quoted on TV shows. There are actual actors who have become Mudang. (This is a story for another time, if I get the chance.)

This is likely the reason why the ancestral hunters in 'KPDH' are depicted as Mudang. A Mudang performs rituals with dance and music in a 'Gut-pan' (ritual site) to receive gods or appease spirits. When you think of the flamboyant clothing of a Mudang or the ritual itself, connecting this image to the concept of a modern idol feels both witty and exquisite.

If you want to see such a Mudang ritual, I recommend the Korean films 'Exhuma' or 'The Wailing'. Both are well-regarded by audiences. The second half of each might be a bit disappointing, but I personally recommend 'Exhuma' more.

## In Closing

The content above is based on things I've heard or read while growing up, so it might be a bit inaccurate. But I think that men of my generation, while differing in small details, probably know these things in a similar way.

If this post gets read a lot, I'll do a bit more research to deliver even more interesting information.
