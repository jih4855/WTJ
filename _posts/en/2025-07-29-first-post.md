As I write my first post, I find myself reflecting on the journey that brought me to this moment of starting a blog.

## A Personal Space in the Digital World

In an era where Korean culture has become mainstream globally, from K-pop dominating charts to Korean dramas captivating audiences worldwide, I wanted to create a more personal space. This blog isn't about following trends or chasing viewsâ€”it's about sharing genuine experiences and thoughts from my corner of South Korea.

## The Role of AI in Modern Writing

I want to be transparent about something from the start: much of the content on this blog, particularly the English and Japanese translations, will be created with the assistance of Large Language Models (LLMs). This isn't about replacing human creativity, but rather about breaking down language barriers and making my thoughts accessible to a broader audience.

The Korean posts will always be my authentic voice, written directly by me. The translations, while AI-assisted, will still carry the essence of my original thoughts and experiences.

## What to Expect

This blog will focus on:
- Personal reflections on life in South Korea
- Local spots and hidden gems around Jinju and Gyeongnam province
- Cultural observations from a 30-something office worker's perspective
- Honest reviews and recommendations

I hope this space becomes a bridge between cultures, offering readers a glimpse into everyday life in Korea beyond the polished surface of mainstream media.

Thank you for joining me on this journey. Let's explore together.
